Sometimes locking your computer can take a long time if you have a tight schedeule, slow computer or you don't want to navigate Windows' bloated menus. **QuickLock** solves all these problems by having an easy to click lock button and ready to use keybind for any issues you may have.

## Intentions

We aim to make an application that makes locking easier and to protect unwanted users from accessing your computer. We are aware that there are many other ways to lock your computer, but our goal is to make an applicaton that does all of that in one tiny application.
   
## Features
