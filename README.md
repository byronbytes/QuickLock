Sometimes locking your computer can take a long time if you have a tight schedeule, slow computer or you don't want to navigate Windows' bloated menus. **QuickLock** solves all these problems by having an easy to click lock button and ready to use keybind for any issues you may have.

## Intentions

I aim to make an application that makes locking easier and to protect unwanted users from accessing your computer. There are many other ways to lock your computer, but my goal is to make an applicaton that does all of that in one tiny application.
   
## Features

- Lock your computer with an easy on-screen button.
- Ability to make the computer either sleep, lock, logout, hibernate, or shutdown.
- An easy and bindable keybind to lock your computer anytime.
   - You can also choose the action the keybind does in Settings.
- Disable the built in Windows lock key.
- Have custom lock messages.
- Customizable themes for a better experience.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
